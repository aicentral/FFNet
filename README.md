<h1> Input Fast-Forwarding</h1>
<p> <H2> supplied models </h2>
<p> the repository contains model description files ready to be used in caffe to train the models descibed in our paper "Input Fast-Forwarding for Better Deep Learning"
<p> the repository contains model desciptions as well as suggested solver files.
<p> you need to have Caffe installed from <a href=http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/>http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/</a>
<p> To train the model on a different dataset you need to change the data layer in the supplied model.

<p>for any inquiries please contact me on nady at vt.edu
